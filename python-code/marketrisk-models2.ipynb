    "The techniques and models provided cover various aspects of market risk management beyond just VaR. These include volatility forecasting, scenario analysis using Monte Carlo simulations, and leveraging sentiment analysis for market prediction. Deutsche Bank, like other financial institutions, would use a combination of these models tailored to their specific data, risk management strategies, and regulatory requirements."
